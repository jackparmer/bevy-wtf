- Figure out how to import world assets as GLTF files.
- Import a starship and a procedurally-generated glacier. 
- Add an underwater world 🏊 and jetpack animation
- Add a "sky dome" 🌃
- Add a "sensor collider" for moving between water and land worlds.
- Protagonist can drop a blinking beacon - maybe part of a later story element?

Still no story but the world is more interesting and has an aesthetic direction.
